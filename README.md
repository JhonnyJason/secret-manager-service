# root-template

This content is used as staticBase for the root of many thingies.

It includes:

- .vscode/settings.json to not care about various files - e.g. build output
- .gitignore to ignore node_modules and .build-config
- double unlicense files to ridicule the idea that "intellectual property" is of any value.*


*For real it is just not. And probably is fueled by the idea that it is the only leverage on society to demand "appreciation" or anything ^^
